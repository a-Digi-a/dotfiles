# Digi's Dotfiles!

These are made for **linux** only

# Installation 

These dotfiles are managed with **YADM** (yet another dotfiles manager):

```shell
sudo pacman -S yadm
yadm clone git@github.com:a-Digi-a/dotfiles.git
yadm status
```
I will be making a script which installs the packages required for arch based systems soon!
